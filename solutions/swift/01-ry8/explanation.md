The entry point for your Interpreter implementation is in `Sources/main.swift`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code: 

```swift
// Uncomment this block to pass the first stage
if fileContents.isEmpty {
   print("EOF  null")
} else {
   print("Scanner not implemented")
   exit(1)
}
```

Push your changes to pass the first stage:

```
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```
