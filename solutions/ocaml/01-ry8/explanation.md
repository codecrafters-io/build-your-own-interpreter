The entry point for your Interpreter implementation is in `src/main.ml`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code: 

```ocaml
(* Uncomment this block to pass the first stage *)
print_endline "EOF  null"; (* Placeholder, remove this line when implementing the scanner *)
```

Push your changes to pass the first stage:

```
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```
